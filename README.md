- **Build System:** CMake
- **Frameworks & Tools:**
  - [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for 2D graphics and game development.
  - [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit testing.
  - [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-for-ide/visual-studio/) for static code analysis to ensure code quality.
 
## Contributing

Iâ€™m more than happy to receive feedback from experienced developers to help me grow and refine my skills. Instead of direct code contributions, I welcome suggestions and best practices regarding code structure, design patterns, or any other aspects of modern C++ and game development. Feel free to open an issue or leave a comment with your insights!

However should you like the game I'd happily cooperate with any artists, musicians or writers to deliver more and better content.
